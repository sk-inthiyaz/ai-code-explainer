- ✅ **Data Table** with columns:
  - # (Index)
  - Title (with function signature)
  - Difficulty (color-coded badges)
  - Topic
  - Test Cases (total + hidden count)
  - Acceptance Rate
  - Total Submissions
  - Actions (Edit & Delete buttons)

#### **Edit Modal**
- ✅ Edit problem title
- ✅ Edit description
- ✅ Change difficulty level
- ✅ Update topic
- ✅ Modify constraints
- ✅ Update hints (comma-separated)

### 2. **Backend API Endpoints** (`practiceRoutes.js`)

#### **Existing Endpoints**
```

DELETE /api/practice/admin/problems/:id     → Delete a problem
```

#### **NEW Endpoint Added**
```
PUT    /api/practice/admin/problems/:id     → Update a problem
```

**Update Endpoint Details:**
- Updates: title, description, difficulty, topic, constraints, hints
- Returns updated problem object
- Validates data before saving

### 3. **CSS Styling** (`AdminPracticeProblems.css`)

#### **New Styles Added**

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('upload');
const [problems, setProblems] = useState([]);
const [stats, setStats] = useState({...});
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
const [filterDifficulty, setFilterDifficulty] = useState('All');
const [filterTopic, setFilterTopic] = useState('All');
const [editingProblem, setEditingProblem] = useState(null);
const [showEditModal, setShowEditModal] = useState(false);
```

### Data Fetching
- `fetchProblems()`: Gets all problems on mount and after CRUD operations
- `fetchStats()`: Gets statistics for dashboard cards
- Both use JWT token from localStorage

### Filtering Logic
```javascript
const filteredProblems = problems.filter(problem => {
  const matchesSearch = /* title or description contains search term */
  const matchesDifficulty = /* matches selected difficulty */
  const matchesTopic = /* matches selected topic */
  return matchesSearch && matchesDifficulty && matchesTopic;
});
```

### CRUD Operations
- **Create**: `validateAndUpload()` - Uploads new problems
- **Read**: `fetchProblems()` - Retrieves all problems
- **Update**: `handleUpdateProblem()` - Updates existing problem
- **Delete**: `handleDeleteProblem()` - Removes problem
