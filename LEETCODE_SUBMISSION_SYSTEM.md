Your Practice Problems system now has a professional LeetCode-style interface with:

### 1. **Back Button** ⬅️
- Located at the top-left of the problem detail page
- Uses your custom left-arrow icon
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Easy navigation back to problems list

### 2. **Tabbed Panel Interface** 📑
Two tabs for better organization:
- **Description Tab**: Full problem details, examples, constraints, hints
- **Submissions Tab**: Shows submission results with verdict and test cases

### 3. **Smart Auto-Switch** 🔄
- When you click **Submit**, the system automatically switches to the **Submissions tab**
- Shows your submission result immediately
- Perfect for quick feedback

### 4. **Acceptance Rate Display** 📊
- Visible in the problem metadata
- Shows problem difficulty at a glance
- Helps you understand problem complexity

### 5. **Beautiful Submission Results** 🎨
Just like LeetCode:
- **Accepted**: Green background with success icon (✓)
- **Not Accepted**: Red background with error icon (✗)
- Shows verdict, runtime, and memory usage
- Displays all test case results with pass/fail status

## 📋 Feature Breakdown

### A. Back Button Component
```jsx
<button 
  className="back-button-icon" 
  onClick={handleBackClick}

---

### C. Submission Results Display

When you submit code, you see:

#### Success (Accepted)
```
✓ Accepted

3/3 test cases passed
```

#### Failed
```
✗ Not Accepted
Some test cases failed

Runtime: 62ms
Memory: 15MB

2/3 test cases passed
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Step 1: User Views Problem
- Problem description shown in Description tab
- Sees title, difficulty, topic, acceptance rate
- Full problem details with examples

### Step 2: User Writes Code
- Uses Monaco Editor on the right side
- Can switch languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, C++)
- Code template provided as starter

### Step 3: User Submits
```javascript
handleSubmit() → 
  - Sends code to server
  - Server runs test cases
  - Returns results
  - Component switches to Submissions tab
  - Displays verdict and results
  - Saves to submission history
```

### Step 4: View Results
- Green card if all tests passed ✓
- Red card if any test failed ✗
- Detailed view of each test case
- Runtime and memory usage displayed
- Can switch back to Description tab to review problem

---

## 📊 Acceptance Rate Explanation

**What is Acceptance Rate?**
- Shows the percentage of users who solved this problem
- Calculated as: (Successful Submissions / Total Submissions) × 100
- Displayed as: `Acceptance: 45.2%`

**How is it calculated?**
```
If 1000 people attempt a problem:
- 450 solve it correctly
- 550 don't solve it (or partially solve)

Acceptance Rate = (450 / 1000) × 100 = 45%
```

**What does it tell you?**
- **High (>70%)**: Easier problem
- **Medium (30-70%)**: Medium difficulty
- **Low (<30%)**: Hard problem

## 🗂️ File Changes

### Modified Files:
1. **ProblemDetail.jsx** - Added tabbed interface and back button
2. **Practice.css** - Added comprehensive styling for all new features

### Key Changes in ProblemDetail.jsx:
```jsx
// New imports
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import leftArrowIcon from '../images/left-arrow (1).png';

// New state
const [activeDescriptionTab, setActiveDescriptionTab] = useState('description');
const [submissionHistory, setSubmissionHistory] = useState([]);

// New function
const handleBackClick = () => navigate('/practice/problems');

// Auto-switch on submit
setActiveDescriptionTab('submissions'); // Line in handleSubmit
```
