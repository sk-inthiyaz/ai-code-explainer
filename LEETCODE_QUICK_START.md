## Understanding Acceptance Rate

### What It Is
```
Percentage of successful solutions out of total attempts

Acceptance Rate = (Successful / Total) × 100
```

### Examples
```
75% Acceptance   → Easy problem (most solve it)
45% Acceptance   → Medium problem (half solve it)
15% Acceptance   → Hard problem (few solve it)
```

### What It Tells You
```
High (>70%)  = Start here (easy)
Medium (30-70%) = Good practice (medium)
Low (<30%)   = Challenge yourself (hard)
```

### How It's Calculated
```
System tracks:
1. Total submissions for this problem
2. How many succeeded
3. Calculates percentage
4. Updates after each submission
```

## Pro Tips

### 📌 Best Practices

1. **Run Before Submit**
   ```
   Always run with examples first
   Catches obvious errors early
   ```

2. **Check Edge Cases**
   ```
   Empty input?
   Single element?
   Large numbers?
   Special characters?
   ```

3. **Read Error Messages**
   ```
   Test shows exact failure point
   Use it to debug faster
   ```

4. **Use Hints Wisely**
   ```
   Try yourself first
   Use hints as last resort
   Understand the solution
   ```

5. **Review Constraints**
   ```
   Time limit affects approach
   Memory limit affects structure
   Input range affects algorithm
   ```

### 🎯 Problem-Solving Strategy

```
1. Read problem 2-3 times
2. Work through examples by hand
3. Identify algorithm needed
4. Write pseudocode first
5. Implement in editor
6. Test with examples
7. Submit when confident
8. Learn from failures
```

### 📈 Progressive Difficulty

```
Session 1: Try 3 Easy problems (get 3/3)
Session 2: Try 3 Easy problems (solidify)
Session 3: Mix Easy + Medium (2 easy, 1 medium)
Session 4: More Medium problems
Session 5: Challenge with Hard problems
```

## Understanding Results

### Accepted Result

```
What it means:
✓ Your code works correctly
✓ All test cases pass
✓ Algorithm is correct
✓ No syntax errors
✓ Within time/memory limits

Next step:
→ Try another problem
→ Or try harder variant
→ Move to next difficulty
```

### Failed Result - Wrong Answer

```
What it means:
✗ Code runs but gives wrong output
✗ Logic error in solution
✗ Missed edge case
✗ Algorithm incomplete

Debug steps:
1. Check failed test case
2. Compare expected vs actual

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

### When You Submit

```
1. Frontend sends your code + language + problemId
2. Backend receives request
3. Runs all test cases against your code
4. Compares output with expected
5. Records results
6. Sends response with:
   - success (boolean)
   - testResults (array)
   - executionTime (number)
   - memoryUsage (string)
7. Frontend receives and displays
8. Automatically switches tab
9. Shows beautiful result card
```

### What Data Is Saved

```
Each submission records:
- User ID (who submitted)
- Problem ID (which problem)
- Code (what was submitted)
- Language (JavaScript, Python, etc)
- Status (accepted/failed)
- Runtime (execution time)
- Memory (RAM used)
- Test results (all tests)
- Timestamp (when submitted)
```
