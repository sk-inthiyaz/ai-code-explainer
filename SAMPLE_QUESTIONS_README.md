## Sample JSON Structure

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "title": "Question Title",
      "description": "Problem description with examples...",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "testCases": [
        {
          "input": "Sample input",
          "expectedOutput": "Expected output"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

- Make sure all required fields are present: title, description, difficulty, testCases
- Each test case must have input and expectedOutput
- Difficulty must be one of: "easy", "medium", "hard"
