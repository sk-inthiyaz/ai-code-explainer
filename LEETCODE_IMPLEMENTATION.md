# LeetCode-Style Code Editor Implementation

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes

1. **New `/api/streak/run` Endpoint** (streakController.js)
   - Runs ONLY public test cases (where `isHidden = false`)
   - Returns detailed results with passed/failed count
   - Shows first failed test case with actual vs expected output
   - Does NOT update streak or mark question as solved

2. **Enhanced `/api/streak/submit` Endpoint** (streakController.js)
   - Runs ALL test cases (public + hidden)
   - Returns detailed failure information
   - Shows specific test case number that failed (e.g., "7/67")
   - Displays input, expected output, and actual output for failed cases
   - Only updates streak and marks as solved if ALL tests pass

3. **Updated Routes** (streakRoutes.js)
   - Added `POST /api/streak/run` route with authentication

### Frontend Changes

1. **Redesigned SolvePage.jsx**
   - Split into two main panels (problem description + code editor)
   - Added **Run** button (tests only public cases)
   - Added **Submit** button (tests all cases)
   - Tabbed interface: "Test Cases" and "Test Results"
   - Only public test cases are visible to users
   - Detailed failure display showing:
     - Test case number (e.g., "Test Case 7/67 Failed")
     - Input that caused the failure
     - Expected output
     - Actual output (in red)

2. **New SolvePage.css**
   - LeetCode-inspired design
   - Split-screen layout
   - Color-coded results (green for pass, red for fail)
   - Responsive design
   - Dark mode support
   - Professional styling with proper spacing and typography

## 🎯 How It Works

### User Workflow

1. **Run Button** (Test Public Cases)
   ```
   User clicks "Run" → 
   Backend filters public test cases → 
   Executes code (currently mocked) → 
   Returns results to frontend → 
   Shows passed/failed count + first failure details
   ```

2. **Submit Button** (Test All Cases)
   ```
   User clicks "Submit" → 
   Backend runs ALL test cases → 
   If all pass: Updates streak, marks as solved, redirects to dashboard
   If some fail: Shows which test failed with details
   ```

### Example Failure Display

```
❌ Test Case 7/67 Failed

Input:
[2, 122, 232], k=2

Expected:
[122, 232]

Got:
[2, 122]
```

## 📝 Model Structure

The `StreakQuestion` model already has the `isHidden` field on test cases:

```javascript
testCases: [{
  input: String,
  expectedOutput: String,
  explanation: String,
  isHidden: { type: Boolean, default: false }  // false = public, true = hidden
}]
```

## 🔧 What's Mock (Needs Real Implementation)

Currently, the test execution is mocked:
```javascript
const passedTest = true; // Replace with actual code execution
```

**To implement real code execution**, you'll need:
1. Code execution service (Docker containers recommended)
2. Sandboxed environment for security
3. Language-specific runners (Node.js for JavaScript, Python interpreter, etc.)
4. Timeout handling (prevent infinite loops)
5. Memory limits

Popular options:
- Judge0 API
- Piston API
- Custom Docker-based solution

## 🎨 Features Implemented

✅ LeetCode-style split-screen layout  
✅ Run button (public test cases only)  
✅ Submit button (all test cases)  
✅ Public/hidden test case filtering  
✅ Detailed failure reporting with specific test case  
✅ Visual distinction between expected and actual output  
✅ Test case numbering (e.g., "7/67")  
✅ Tabbed interface (Test Cases / Results)  
✅ Responsive design  
✅ Dark mode support  
✅ Success animations and streak display  

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Admin Interface** - Mark test cases as public/hidden from admin dashboard
2. **Real Code Execution** - Integrate with code execution service
3. **Language-Specific Templates** - Better starter code for each language
4. **Code Hints** - Show hints after failed attempts
5. **Solution Discussion** - Allow users to see/share solutions after solving
6. **Performance Metrics** - Track runtime and memory usage
7. **Code Syntax Highlighting** - Use Monaco Editor or CodeMirror

## 📁 Files Modified

### Backend
- `server/controllers/streakController.js` - Added runCode function, enhanced submitSolution
- `server/routes/streakRoutes.js` - Added POST /run route

### Frontend
- `client/src/components/StreakQuestion/SolvePage.jsx` - Complete redesign
- `client/src/components/StreakQuestion/SolvePage.css` - New LeetCode-style CSS

## 🧪 Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Start the server: `cd server && npm start`
2. Start the client: `cd client && npm start`
3. Navigate to `/streak/solve`
4. Click **Run** to test public cases
5. Click **Submit** to test all cases and submit solution

The backend currently mocks all tests as passing. Modify the `passedTest` variable to `false` to simulate failures.
