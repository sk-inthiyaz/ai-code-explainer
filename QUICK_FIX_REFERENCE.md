# ⚡ Upload Problems Fix - Quick Reference Card

## 🎯 What Was Wrong
Upload said "Success!" but problems didn't show in History table.

## ✅ What Was Fixed
Added 500ms delay to let database finish saving before fetching data.

## 🔑 Key Changes

### In `AdminPracticeProblems.jsx`:

#### Change 1: Added Delay After Upload
```javascript
// BEFORE
fetchProblems();  // Too fast ❌

// AFTER
setTimeout(() => {
  fetchProblems();    // Waits 500ms ✅
  fetchStats();
  setActiveTab('history');
}, 500);
```

#### Change 2: Added Console Logging
```javascript
console.log('🔄 Fetching problems...');
console.log('✅ Fetched problems:', count, 'problems');
console.log('📊 Fetching stats...');
console.log('✅ Upload successful:', result);
console.log('❌ Upload failed:', error);
```

#### Change 3: Removed Unused Variable
```javascript
// Removed: const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState(null);
```
