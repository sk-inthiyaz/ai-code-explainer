## 🔧 HOW ADMIN UPLOADS WORK NOW

### Current Flow:

1. **Admin Access:** Admin logs in with `isAdmin: true` in User model

2. **Upload 5 Daily Questions:**
```javascript
POST /api/streak/admin/daily
Headers: { Authorization: Bearer <admin-token> }
Body: {
  "date": "2025-10-17",  // Optional, defaults to today
  "questions": [
    {
      // Level 1 (Easy)
      "title": "Reverse a String",
      "description": "Write a function to reverse a string",
      "constraints": "Length: 1 to 1000 characters",
      "hints": ["Use two pointers", "Or use built-in reverse"],
      "starterCode": "function reverseString(s) {\n  // Your code here\n}",
      "testCases": [
        {
          "input": "hello",
          "expectedOutput": "olleh",
          "explanation": "Reversed 'hello' is 'olleh'"
        }
      ]
    },
    // ... 4 more questions (Level 2, 3, 4, 5)
  ]
}
```

3. **Backend Logic:**
- Validates exactly 5 questions
- Assigns level 1-5 to each question
- Stores with activeDate
- Prevents duplicates (unique index on date + level)

---

## 🎯 HOW USER FLOW WORKS

### User Journey:

1. **User Opens Streak Page**
   - Component: `StreakPage.jsx`
   - Renders: `StreakStatusCard` + `UserStreakQuestionCard`

2. **Fetches Today's Question**
   - API: `GET /api/streak/today`
   - Backend checks user's level
   - Returns question matching user level
   - Shows "already solved" if completed today

3. **User Clicks "Start Solving"**
   - Navigates to `/streak/solve`
   - Component: `SolvePage.jsx` (TO BE CREATED)
   - Shows question + code editor

4. **User Writes Code & Submits**
   - API: `POST /api/streak/submit`
   - Body: `{ questionId, code }`
   - Backend validates against test cases

5. **On Success:**
   - Streak increases by 1
   - Level auto-updates (every 7 days)
   - Badges awarded (7, 14, 21, 28 days)
   - User sees celebration message

6. **Streak Reset:**
   - If user misses a day, streak resets to 0
   - Longest streak is preserved

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Priority 1 (Critical):
1. Create `SolvePage.jsx` - Users need to solve questions
2. Update `AdminQuestionForm.jsx` - Admin needs to upload 5 questions

### Priority 2 (Important):
3. Add CSS files for all components
4. Configure routes in `App.js`
5. Create Leaderboard component

### Priority 3 (Nice to have):
6. Add animations & transitions
7. Email notifications for streak breaks
8. Social sharing features
9. Code execution sandbox (actual test running)
