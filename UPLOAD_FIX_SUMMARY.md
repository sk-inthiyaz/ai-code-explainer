# ✅ FIXED: Upload Problems Not Showing in History

## 🎯 Problem
After uploading 7 problems, they were not showing up in the "📚 Problems History" tab even though the upload was successful.

## 🔧 Root Cause
The frontend was fetching problems **too quickly** after the upload request returned. The database hadn't finished writing all 7 problems yet, so `fetchProblems()` returned empty or partial results.

## ✅ Solution
Added a **500ms delay** before fetching problems and stats after upload:

```javascript
// BEFORE (❌ Too fast)
if (res.ok) {
  toast.success(`✅ ${expectedCount} problem(s) uploaded successfully!`);
  fetchProblems();        // Called immediately ❌
  fetchStats();
  setActiveTab('history');
}

// AFTER (✅ Fixed)
if (res.ok) {
  toast.success(`✅ ${expectedCount} problem(s) uploaded successfully!`);
  
  // Wait 500ms for database to finish writing
  setTimeout(() => {
    fetchProblems();      // Called after delay ✅
    fetchStats();
    setActiveTab('history');
  }, 500);
}
```

## 🎁 Bonus Improvements
1. ✅ Added **console logging** to track upload/fetch process
2. ✅ Removed unused `selectedFile` state variable
3. ✅ Better error handling with detailed console messages
