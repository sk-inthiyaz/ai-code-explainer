### Feature Verification

#### Validation Logic
- [x] Accepts regular questions (with `difficulty`)
- [x] Accepts streak questions (with `functionSignature`)
- [x] Rejects questions missing both fields
- [x] Rejects questions missing common fields
- [x] Clear error messages for failures

#### Auto-Detection
- [x] Detects regular format (has `difficulty`)
- [x] Detects streak format (has `functionSignature`)
- [x] Routes to correct endpoint based on format
- [x] Formats payload correctly per endpoint

#### Streak Question Support
- [x] Validates exactly 5 questions
- [x] Rejects if < 5 or > 5 questions
- [x] Adds date in correct format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- [x] Sends to `/api/streak/admin/daily`

#### Input Format Validation
- [x] Single param: `"[2,2,1]"` (no newlines)
- [x] Two params: `"[2,7,11,15]\n9"` (newline separated)
- [x] String params: `"hello"` (raw string, no quotes)
- [x] Test cases properly formatted

### Example File Verification

**admin-upload-streak.json:**
- [x] Valid JSON syntax
- [x] Contains exactly 5 questions
- [x] Level 1 (Easy): singleNumber(nums)
- [x] Level 2 (Mid): twoSum(nums, target)
- [x] Level 3 (Mid-Easy): isValid(s)
- [x] Level 4 (Hard): merge(nums1, nums2)
- [x] Level 5 (Mix): lengthOfLongestSubstring(s)

Each question has:
- [x] title
- [x] description
- [x] constraints
- [x] hints
- [x] functionSignature with name, params, returnType
- [x] codeTemplate for all 4 languages (javascript, python, java, cpp)
- [x] testCases with input, expectedOutput, explanation, isHidden

### Backward Compatibility

- [x] Regular question uploads still work
- [x] Existing API endpoints unchanged
- [x] No breaking changes to database schema
- [x] No changes required for existing clients
- [x] Pure additive feature

### Error Handling

- [x] "Invalid question format at index X" - proper error
- [x] "Missing 'difficulty' or 'functionSignature'" - specific error
- [x] "Streak questions must have exactly 5 questions" - validation error
- [x] All errors caught and reported to UI with toast

### Browser Integration

- [x] toast.success() for success messages
- [x] toast.error() for error messages
- [x] setError() for display in UI
- [x] setJsonPreview() for showing preview
- [x] setQuestions() for updating list

### Production Readiness

- [x] No console errors or warnings
- [x] No unhandled exceptions
- [x] Proper error handling and recovery
- [x] User-friendly error messages
- [x] No security issues (uses Bearer token)
- [x] No hardcoded endpoints (localhost already used)

## How to Verify Yourself

### 1. Check Code Changes
```bash
# View updated AdminDashboard.js
code client/src/components/pages/AdminDashboard.js
```

Look for:
- Lines 74-88: Dual format validation âœ…
- Lines 100-126: Format detection and routing âœ…
- Lines 140-155: Updated success messages âœ…

### 2. Validate Example File
```bash
# Check admin-upload-streak.json syntax
node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('admin-upload-streak.json')))"
```

Should output: Valid JSON with 5 questions âœ…

### 3. Test Upload Flow (Manual)

**Step 1:** Start app
```bash
npm start
```

**Step 2:** Navigate to AdminDashboard
```
http://localhost:3000/admin
```

**Step 3:** Upload `admin-upload-streak.json`
- Click "ðŸ“¥ Upload Questions" tab
- Select `admin-upload-streak.json`
- Should show âœ… "JSON file validated successfully!"
- Should show preview of 5 questions
- Should have format detected as Streak âœ…

**Step 4:** Import
- Click "Import 5 Question(s)"
- Should succeed with 201 status
- Should show: "ðŸ”¥ 5 streak questions uploaded successfully for today!"

### 4. Verify Database
```bash
# Check MongoDB for streak questions
db.streakquestions.find({ activeDate: "2025-10-24" })
```

Should show:
- 5 documents
- Each with level 1-5
- Each with unique functionSignature âœ…
- Each with codeTemplate for all 4 languages âœ…

### 5. Test Frontend Display
```
Visit http://localhost:3000/streak
```

Should show:
- 5 levels with today's questions
- Each level showing correct title
- Code editor with correct template (not "twoSum" for all)
- Correct function signature in editor âœ…
