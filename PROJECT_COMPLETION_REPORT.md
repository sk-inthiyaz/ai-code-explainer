3. Stores in database with problem metadata
4. Displays in history with blue badge

**User Experience:**
```
✓ Single Number          Level 5  Python
  Solved: Oct 23, 2025 3:45 PM

✓ Two Sum                Level 3  JavaScript  
  Solved: Oct 23, 2025 2:30 PM
```

**Benefits:**

```
🔴 Compilation/Runtime Error
Line 3: error: 'd' does not name a type
Line 3: error: expected ';' before 'return'

2 errors found
```

**Benefits:**

## What's Different Now

### User Workflow - Before
1. User solves problem in JavaScript
2. Clicks submit
3. If error, sees raw compiler output (hard to read)
4. Can't tell which language was used previously

### User Workflow - After
1. User solves problem in Python
2. If error, sees **formatted error with line numbers**
3. Knows exactly what went wrong and where
4. When viewing history, sees **Python badge** with other solved problems

---

## Testing Guide

### Quick Tests (10 scenarios provided)

**Test 1-4:** Error display for each language
- C++ compilation error
- Python syntax error
- Java compilation error
- JavaScript runtime error

**Test 5-8:** Language tracking for each language
- JavaScript badge ✓
- Python badge ✓
- Java badge ✓
- C++ badge ✓

**Test 9-10:** Special cases
